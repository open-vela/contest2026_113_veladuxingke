    "When the user asks about weather, temperature, or forecasts.\n" \
    "\n" \
    "## How to use\n" \
    "1. Use get_current_time to know the current date\n" \
    "2. Use web_search with a query like \"weather in [city] today\"\n" \
    "3. Extract temperature, conditions, and forecast from results\n" \

    "\n" \
    "## How to use\n" \
    "1. Use get_current_time for today's date\n" \
    "2. Read " AGENT_MEMORY_DIR "/MEMORY.md for user preferences and context\n" \
    "3. Read today's daily note if it exists\n" \

    "When the user asks to create a new skill, teach the bot something, or add a new capability.\n" \
    "\n" \
    "## How to create a skill\n" \
    "1. Choose a short, descriptive name (lowercase, hyphens ok)\n" \

    "## Best practices\n" \
    "- Keep skills concise — the context window is limited\n" \

    "- Include specific tool calls the agent should use\n" \
    "- Test by asking the agent to use the new skill\n" \

    "4. Convert temperature_x100 and humidity_x100 by dividing by 100; convert light_x10 by dividing by 10. Report eco2_ppm and tvoc_ppb as ppm and ppb.\n" \

    "2. Call routine_schedule_update with schedule_id, hour, minute, text, and expected_text from the current item.\n" \
    "3. The change is a persistent daily template update; report the saved values only after the tool succeeds.\n" \
    "4. Do not add or delete slots, and do not use cron_add for these three routine-manager items.\n\n" \
    "## Important distinction\n" \
    "The three routine_mgr slots (喝水, 专注, 通风) are fixed daily " \
    "templates, not ai_agent cron jobs. For today's reminders or a " \
    "question about where one is configured, never call cron_list; read " \
    "/data/routine/status.json with run_shell. The persistent template is " \
    "/data/routine/config.json, and it is changed only by " \
    "routine_schedule_update for an existing slot.\n\n" \
    "## Data interpretation\n" \
    "The metric bits are: temperature=1, humidity=2, light=4, eCO2=8, and TVOC=16. Test every metric against each mask separately. A set bit in live_mask means the value is live; demo_mask, warmup_mask, stale_mask, and offline_mask explain non-live or simulated values. If the status file is missing, say that routine_mgr is not ready. If clock_valid is zero, say that the schedule date is unavailable and do not present entries as today's reminders.\n\n" \
    "## Example\n" \
    "User: Read the current desktop environment and tell me today's reminders.\n" \
    "-> get_current_time\n" \
